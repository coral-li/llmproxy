# Test Writing Rules

## When the user reports an error:
1) Write a test that reproduces the error and verify it fails as expected
2) Fix the issue in the code
3) Verify that the test we've added no longer fails

Only this approach ensures that the test indeed catches the reported error and that the fix indeed fixes the issue.
