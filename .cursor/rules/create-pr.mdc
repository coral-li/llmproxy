# Creating Pull Requests - Mandatory Instructions

## 1. Create Feature Branch
- Check if we are already on a feature branch.
- If not, create one with a descriptive name

## 2. Code Quality Verification
Always run `make all` before creating a PR to ensure:
- **Black** formatting is applied
- **isort** import sorting is correct
- **flake8** linting passes (including complexity checks)
- **mypy** type checking passes
- **pytest** all tests pass

## 3. PR Creation Process
- Always review which files you're adding to prevent committing unwanted files. **Before committing, verify**:
    - ✅ No dotfiles (`.env`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, etc.) unless intentional
    - ✅ No temporary files (`.tmp`, `.bak`, `~` files, etc.)
    - ✅ No build artifacts (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `dist/`, etc.)
    - ✅ No sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens)
    - ✅ No large binary files unless necessary
- If appropriate, add unwanted files to .gitignore
- Create PR via GitHub API
    - **Clear title** describing the feature/fix
    - **Comprehensive description** including:
    - Overview of changes
    - Configuration examples
    - Testing notes
    - Feature checklist with ✅ markers
